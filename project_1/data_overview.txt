  The following data elements are present:
  utc_datetime,
  mt_datetime,  --utc datetime converted to mountain time
  utc_time_ms,  --utc time milliseconds
  s_ip, --server ip
  cs_method,  --request method
  s_sitename,  --server sitename/domain

  cs_bytes,  --client to server bytes received
  time_taken_ms,  --time taken for request to complete in milliseconds
  visitorid_hashed  --eBags unique visitor id, cryptographically hashed
  
  Weblogs are anonymized with cookie data removed and visitor id transformed using AES 256 cryptographic hash. With the following HIVE function: reflect('org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils', 'sha256Hex', 'visitorid').  Weblogs are filtered to only include product detail page views (cs_uri_stem like '%/product/%' or cs_uri_stem like '%/hproduct/%') and cart requests (cs_uri_stem like '%/cart/%')
%/product/% records represent views of product detail pages by specific visitor id.
%/hproduct/% records represent views of hybrid product detail pages by specific visitor id.
%/cart/add% records represent cart add of product (look at cs_referrer to see what product was added although, and this is confusing and important, it’s the number preceding the ?productid= URL variable that corresponds and relates to the product_catalog information).  For example, this is a card/add referrer for <ProductId>282152</ProductId>
https://www.ebags.com/product/pathfinder-gear/gear-burro-bag/282152?productid=10328895


/product_catalog
  Full XML dump of active product catalog.  Key data elements:
<ProductCatalogItem>
  <ProductId>1057_2</ProductId>  - Note: this data element with underscore and trailing information truncated will match the id referenced in the web logs.  Each product will have product level information like weights and dimensions, product features, various attributes, and image references, as well as child level information for each associated SKU.
