  Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?  When looking at hospital procedures related to the effectiveness of care, the main point of variability concerns the availability and completeness of the measure data.  There is a huge variance here amongst hospitals the two procedures data sets.  Of the set of 43 different timely and effectiveness procedures available in the data (filtered by emergency services providers only), only 6 procedures have scores available for 75% or more of the hospitals (run query 1 in hospital_variability.sql to see these results):

  In conclusion, through examining the procedure data we see that the major variance is that it is sparsely complete as various procedures do not have score data available for many hospitals.  Because of this, and our desire to compare procedures as widely as possible across the set of hospitals, we will limit our procedure analysis to procedures that are in the 75th percentile of completeness with respect to score availability.  Additionally, footnotes for the procedure data were reviewed and it is determined that any scores with footnotes cautioning incomplete or inaccurate data will also be suppressed (footnotes 1, 5, 7, and 11).  The result of this preliminary examination will limit our analysis to 12 effective care procedures and 7 readmissions and death procedures.
